+ Project summary: The project estimates latent factors by gradient descent with probabilistic assumptions to create user-factor matrix and item-factor matrix. In post-processing, we used KNN and Kernel Ridge Regression to construct the second regression terms to improve the model, and combined the result with the original model using linear regression. We then campared the two methods.
