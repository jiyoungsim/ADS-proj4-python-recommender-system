# Project 4: Algorithm implementation and evaluation: Collaborative Filtering
### Doc Folder

The final deliverables for this project are:
+ PMF_main.pdf (see PMF_main.html for better view)
+ PMF_main.ipynb
+ PMF_model.py
+ Probabilistic Matrix Factorization.pdf

The model was trained and tested in Google Colab using the same lines of code. The computation time is also based on the running time using Google Colab GPU. Running this script in CPU will result in longer running time.

Other files are included to show work done in process.
